## Project

Etheruem has powered developer to write smart contracts, but it got some bottleneck in terms of high txn fee, slow speed, UX, and many other things over some time.

Near is an unmatched blockchain protocol build, but the problem is its very new in space. There are lots of assets which needed to be moved from eth to near. For that, we need a simple bridge. The good part is  Near has recently built an ETH<>Near bridge. 

Here I have created an erc20 token in eth and used the bridge to swap on near. There is a cool video also. Please have a look at it.
